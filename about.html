               <h2>Vox Serpentis</h2>
                    <p>Vox (he/him) is a Satanist, occultist, and shitty wizard of well over a decade. He is the glorious leader, the prettiest princess, and a lover of all things pumpkin spice. He enthusiastically plays with plastic war dollies, hits people with swords, and spends more time thinking, tinkering, and theorizing about magick than anyone reasonably should. He is also very humble.</p>
                    <p>Judged "Most Likely to Start a Cult" by the community at large, Vox's schemes are constantly thwarted by Phenex and Nine, who actually do all the work around here.</p>
               <h2>Phenex Apocrypha</h2>
                    <p>Phenex Apocrypha (he/it) is a self-identified cradle witch, having been born to Neo-pagan parents and brought up among witches, druids, and mystics. However, in his early twenties, he found himself yearning for a different spiritual home, and swiftly found himself strolling down the path of Satanism. Ever a bookworm, Phenex was surprised to find that Satanism lacked a central canon of holy texts, and ended up being disappointed with many of the books on offer. This frustration led to a discovery of a career and a spiritual calling – libraries. Immediately he began to collect and read every Satanic book he could get his hands on, with the intent of becoming the devil’s librarian, someone capable of helping others track down the resources that would help them along their paths. He was five years into this work when the Circle of the Fallen came to be, and he seized upon the opportunity to become the community’s dedicated librarian and archivist.</p> 
                    <p>Phenex has a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts and a master’s degree in library and information science, which he tirelessly puts to work in the name of his career and community. When he’s not playing  the serpent offering people the fruit of knowledge, he’s busy spending time with his partners and pets, doing martial arts, or furthering his own spiritual practice.</p>
                    <p>Phenex put together all of the resources for this site.</p>

          <h2>Doctor Nine</h2>
                    <p>Nine (he/they) worships at the altar of temptation into sin, the pursuit of the fruit of knowledge, and rejection of authoritarianism in all its forms. He considers himself a transtheistic Satanist, eclectic pagan (mostly Anglo-Saxon flavored), and "more mystic than wizard". He has his volcano lair already picked out for when he decides to assume his final supervillain form and take over the world via education. Nine <i>will</i> show up when anyone talks about math or brains. This is a threat.</p></p>
                    <p>Extremely depressed and briefly homeless as teenager, now a relatively successful professional with a Ph.D. in neuroscience and pretty damn good life, Dr. Nine is the mostly likely admin to err on the side of compassion. He does most of the plotting and machinations designed to help the religously traumatized youth that show up on our digital doorstep. He also hand-coded this website (nice, isn't it?). If you need to contact the resident technomancer and webmaster, you can email him at <a href="mailto:email@example.com?subject=Mail from our Website">nine@circleofthefallen.org</a>.
