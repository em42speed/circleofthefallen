          <h2>How It All Started</h2>
          <p>In the spring of 2024, three Satanists met each other in a small newly-formed Satanic discord server. By
               midsummer, the server had exploded due to internal drama, as often happens with these sorts of
               communities. The three friends agreed they needed a new server, one to suit their own vision for what a
               Satanic community <i>could</i> look like. Within a year, the community was over 250 members strong, and
               thriving with daily interfaith discussion, magical philosophizing, and mutual support. The three friends
               agreed it was time to extend their reach beyond the confines of Discord. They have thus created this
               website in order to make their community and the resources it as to offer available to all.</p>
          <h2>About The Founders</h2>
          <h3>Vox Serpentis</h3>
          <p>Vox (he/him) is a Satanist, occultist, and shitty wizard of well over a decade. He is the glorious leader,
               the prettiest princess, and a lover of all things pumpkin spice. He enthusiastically plays with plastic
               war dollies, hits people with swords, and spends more time thinking, tinkering, and theorizing about
               magick than anyone reasonably should. He is also very humble.</p>
          <p>Judged "Most Likely to Start a Cult" by the community at large, Vox's schemes are constantly thwarted by
               Phenex and Nine, who actually do all the work around here.</p>
          <h3>Phenex Apocrypha</h3>
          <p>Phenex Apocrypha (he/it) is a self-identified cradle witch, having been born to Neo-pagan parents and
               brought up among witches, druids, and mystics. However, in his early twenties, he found himself yearning
               for a different spiritual home, and swiftly found himself strolling down the path of Satanism. Ever a
               bookworm, Phenex was surprised to find that Satanism lacked a central canon of holy texts, and ended up
               being disappointed with many of the books on offer. This frustration led to a discovery of a career and a
               spiritual calling – libraries. Immediately he began to collect and read every Satanic book he could get
               his hands on, with the intent of becoming the devil’s librarian, someone capable of helping others track
               down the resources that would help them along their paths. He was five years into this work when the
               Circle of the Fallen came to be, and he seized upon the opportunity to become the community’s dedicated
               librarian and archivist.</p>
          <p>Phenex has a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts and a master’s degree in library and information science,
               which he tirelessly puts to work in the name of his career and community. When he’s not playing the
               serpent offering people the fruit of knowledge, he’s busy spending time with his partners and pets, doing
               martial arts, or furthering his own spiritual practice.</p>
          <p>Phenex put together all of the resources for this site.</p>

          <h3>Doctor Nine</h3>
          <p>Nine (he/they) worships at the altar of temptation into sin, the pursuit of the fruit of knowledge, and
               rejection of authoritarianism in all its forms. He considers himself a transtheistic Satanist, eclectic
               pagan (mostly Anglo-Saxon flavored), and "more mystic than wizard". He has his volcano lair already
               picked out for when he decides to assume his final supervillain form and take over the world via
               education. Nine <i>will</i> show up when anyone talks about math or brains. This is a threat.</p>
          </p>
          <p>Extremely depressed and briefly homeless as teenager, now a relatively successful professional with a Ph.D.
               in neuroscience and pretty damn good life, Dr. Nine is the mostly likely admin to err on the side of
               compassion. He does most of the plotting and machinations designed to help the religiously traumatized
               youth that show up on our digital doorstep. He also hand-coded this website (nice, isn't it?). If you
               need to contact the resident technomancer and webmaster, you can email him at <a
                    href="mailto:email@example.com?subject=Mail from our Website">nine@circleofthefallen.org</a>.</p>
          <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
          <p>The Circle of the Fallen is an organization centered on the cultivation of communal ties between Satanists
               of all currents, with a particular focus on theistic Satanism, as it as often been overshadowed by
               atheistic Satanism in the past. We are, very deliberately, not a church or temple. We do not offer
               initiations, require certain beliefs or practices, or in any way tell you how you should act as a
               Satanist. Only you can determine that. We are not here to preach, but to provide a space for Satanists to
               come together and share space, without fear of judgement or pressure to conform. We operate on a core
               philosophy of respect towards each other and a desire to see our religion thrive and refine itself into
               the future. In the ever-delicate balance of maintaining a community based on individualism, we believe
               the best path forward is only enough structure to maintain peace, and plenty of encouragement so that all
               may have the chance to embrace their truest Selves. This philosophy is best encapsulated by our motto.
          </p>
          <h2>Our Motto</h2>
          <h3>Community Without Command:</h3>
          <p>Coined by Vox Serpentis, our first declaration speaks to the intentions we started with; the desire for
               Satanic community without a top-down hierarchy of priesthood or other form of religious leadership. In
               CoF, no one is considered inherently smarter, more spiritual, or more worthwhile than any other, and all
               are free to contribute equally.</p>
          <h3>Wisdom Without Dogma:</h3>
          <p>Coined by Phenex Apocrypha, this declaration defines our approach to education. Satanism is often
               considered to be a religion focused on knowledge, and in order for this knowledge to be properly
               attained, we reject dogmatic thinking and forced compliance. Members of the Circle are free to disagree
               with each other, to compare theories, and to follow different modes of thought. </p>
          <h3>Gods Without Masters:</h3>
          <p>Coined by Doctor Nine, our final declaration articulates the founders’ approach to theistic Satanism. While
               the three of us do believe our gods are real, we do not see them as superior beings we must bow and
               scrape before. Instead, we see them as our equals, friends, and mentors. In other words, we have gods,
               but no masters. While this is a view that the three founders share, you do not have to share it with us
               to be a member of the Circle - as with all things, we value freedom above all else.</p>
