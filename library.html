                    <h2>DISCLAIMER:</h2>
                    <p>
                         Welcome, one and all, to the Library of the Fallen.
                         Here you will find a wealth of books and other
                         resources on Satanism, the occult, and other such
                         related subjects. This library is cultivated with the
                         intent of all sources being free and easily accessible
                         to the reader. All too often, knowledge of magic and
                         mysticism is locked behind paywalls, but here at the
                         Circle, we believe in sharing the fruit of knowledge as
                         widely as we possibly can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Please note that the books and sources shared here do
                         not necessarily reflect the beliefs, practices, or
                         politics of any individual member of the Circle of the
                         Fallen, including the founders and staff. Satanism is a
                         religion with no dogma, and this is a library, not a
                         required reading list. You do not have to read any
                         particular book to be a Satanist, nor will we ever
                         discourage anyone from reading any book. We are are
                         anti-censorship and pro-critical thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         We have done our best to fill this library with books
                         that are free to be shared online. In a few cases,
                         there are books that are so important that it would
                         feel amiss not to include them, but we have no means to
                         do so for free. In these cases, we have provided links
                         to organizations that may allow you to read the book
                         online for a fee, or through a participating
                         organization, such as your local library. If you are a
                         copyright holder of one of these books and wish for us
                         to remove it, please email the technomancer at
                         <strong>nine@circleofthefallen.org</strong> and we will
                         handle it as soon as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>Please enjoy.</p>

                         If you’re brand new to Satanism, or you’re needing a
                         refresher, this is the place to be. Here, you’ll find a
                         selection of books and resources that we at the Circle
                         of the Fallen consider to be very useful for any
                         Satanist to be familiar with. Of course, they aren’t
                         required reading – none of this library is. But
                         word-for-word, these are some of the texts that have
                         had the biggest impact on Satanism to date.

                                   early in their explorations. Though it is
                                   very much a relic of the past, it is a
                                   beloved relic, and still has much wisdom to
                                   share.

                                        <strong>Note:</strong> Some readers may
                                        be concerned by Venus Satanas’ use of
                                        the term Spiritual Satanism, as it is
                                        also used by the group known as Joy of
                                        Satan/Temple of Zeus. We at Circle of
                                        the Fallen have done our own background
                                        check and we have not seen any evidence
                                        that Venus Satanas was ever affiliated
                                        with JoS, despite starting to use the
                                        term at around the same time as them.
                                        This seems to be a coincidence.

                                   unquestionably plagerized, this book took the
                                   world by storm when it was first published,
                                   and it continues to be most people’s gateway
                                   into Satanism. Despite LaVey’s Church of
                                   Satan identifying themselves as an atheistic
                                   form of Satanism, LaVey’s work has been
                                   impactful on Satanists across the
                                   atheist-theist spectrum, especially in
                                   regards to philosophy and attitude. Whether
                                   you grow to love it or come to hate it, it’s
                                   worth reading.

                                   Former member of the Church of Satan and
                                   founder of the Temple of Set, Michael Aquino
                                   provided some of the earliest known channeled
                                   Satanic scripture when he wrote and released
                                   <i>Diabolicon</i>. It was far from the last
                                   piece of writing to come about in this way,
                                   and like all books, it should be read with a
                                   grain of salt, not unquestioning reverence.
                                   However, it has touched the hearts of many a
                                   Satanist, especially at a time when the world
                                   was becoming convinced that theistic Satanism
                                   was impossible to pursue.

                                   It may seem contraditionary to some, to ask
                                   Satanists to read the Bible. For some of you
                                   reading this, it may even be a very
                                   triggering ask. If that’s true for you, I
                                   advise you to take your time and feel no
                                   shame in putting this particular task off
                                   until you feel you are ready for it. But I do
                                   entreat all of you to eventually read the
                                   Bible. It is both the book from which Satan
                                   originates, and the book that is most often
                                   weaponized against us. Learn it, and learn to
                                   see the glimses of Satan shining through. We
                                   recommend this particular edition, as it is
                                   meant for study rather than prayer, and is
                                   rich in scholarly footnotes to help add new
                                   meaning and context.

                                   Despite being a Christian, Milton’s famous
                                   novel paints what is often considered to be
                                   the first sympathetic picture of Satan, as it
                                   depicts his fall from Heaven and subsequent
                                   tempting of Adam and Eve. While this book was
                                   never meant to be written for us, many
                                   Satanists take great enjoyment from this
                                   work, some of us even treat it as scripture.

                                   This text is a piece of Jewish apocrypha,
                                   meaning it was at some point ment to be a
                                   holy book but was eventually rejected from
                                   the Hebrew Bible. It covers the story of the
                                   Watchers, a group of angels who came from
                                   Heaven in order to procreate with human
                                   women, teaching humanity various skills and
                                   creating a race of giants in the process.
                                   While it is not favored by all Satanists,
                                   some of us find it a reach insight into the
                                   lives of fallen angels other that Satan
                                   himself.

                                   <i>The Lesser Key of Solomon</i> claims to be
                                   a manual for the methods of sorcery used by
                                   King Solomon in the Bible when he made use of
                                   various demons to build the temple. While the
                                   magical methods described in the book are
                                   unsavory to many of us who respect demons,
                                   the list of 72 demonic spirits, along with
                                   their sigils, talents, and descriptions has
                                   been an invaluable inspiration to many
                                   Satanists, demonolators, and other
