                              "Why did Satan cherish the spirit of opposition?
                              From a persuasion that he was hardly and
                              injuriously treated. He was not discouraged by the
                              apparent inequality of the contest, because a
                              sense of reason and justice was stronger in his
                              mind than a sense of brute force. [...] He bore
                              his torments with fortitude, because he disdained
                              to be subdued by despotic power. He sought
                              revenge, because he could not think with tameness
                              of the unexpostulating authority that assumed to
                              dispose of him. How beneficial and illustrious
                              might the temper from which these qualities flowed
                              have been found." - William Godwin
