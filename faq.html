          <h2>What is Satanism?</h2>
          <p>Satanism is both simple to define and difficult to explain. At its most basic, it is a religion or
               spiritual practice centered on Satan, also known as the Devil or Lucifer, among other names. Satan’s name
               stems from the Jewish word meaning “adversary” or “accuser,” and the concept of the satan angel of the
               Hebrew Bible. His character was solidified as an embodiment of sin and the ultimate enemy of God in the
               Christian Bible, and he was given another facelift in Islam as the entity Iblis.</p>
          <p>Beyond these basic facts, the question of what a religion based on this entity looks like is a difficult
               one to answer. Unlike nearly every other religion, Satanism has no strict origin point. No cult leader
               wrote a book and started preaching Satan’s teachings, and no culture concocted a mythological framework
               for his followers to believe in or pull wisdom from. Folklore would suggest that people have believed in
               Devil-worship for almost as long as Christianity has existed, but how much actual Devil-worship took
               place is hotly debated, and it is generally agreed by scholars of today that most historical accusations
               of Devil-worship were lies and slander.</p>
          <p> In the modern day Satanism unquestionably exists, and in many forms at that (see our library for
               information on various sects). But rather than all splitting from a singular source, these forms sprouted
               up from the concrete of conventional religion like weeds, twisting around whatever beliefs and practices
               suited them, grasping at the sky for understanding and belonging.</p>
          <p>It is because of this scattered and varied nature that this community does not limit ourselves to one
               “type” of Satanism. There is no true church or final authority in our religion beyond Satan himself, and
               those who are brave enough to live as one of his own. That being said, it very common, though not
               universal, for Satanists to believe that Satan is a liberator, a teacher, and a breaker of chains. We
               tend to value freedom, the furthering of knowledge, and the enjoyment of life.</p>
          <h2>Where did Satanism come from? Did Anton LaVey invent it? Or is it pre-Christian?</h2>
          <p>Neither, actually! The history of Satanism is somewhat long and winding, but it is both
               post-Christian and pre-LaVey.</p>
          <p>Satanism started as a boogeyman in the minds of Christians, the firm belief that anyone practicing non-
               Christian religions was secretly worshiping the Devil. This is why you often saw (and still see) Jews,
               Pagans, and heretical Christians being accused of being Satanists. Over time a small scattering of
               people did end up identifying as Satanists or otherwise revering Satan/Lucifer (Stanisław
               Przybyszewski, Ben Kadosh, the Adonists, etc), but they were spread out across many years, were not
               at all organized, and mostly flew under the radar, culturally speaking. There is no ancient, established
               Satanic religion.</p>
          <p>What Anton LaVey did was created the first mainstream Satanic church, when he founded the Church
               of Satan. This was the birth of atheistic Satanism, and had a serious impact on Satanic philosophy
               overall. However, that does not mean LaVey was the starting point of Satanism, by any means.</p>
          <h2>What does Satanic morality look like?</h2>
          <p>We point this back at the questioner - what does your morality look like? What do you
               consider to be your closest-held values? Can you list them? Where did they come from? Did your mom
               pick them out for you?</p>
          <p>While many groups have attempted to make a moral code that can encompass all of Satanism, the fact
               is, as soon as one group carves into stone that Satanism values individualism and social Darwinism,
               another group pops up to argue Satanism values uplifting the underdog and banding together against the
               tyrants of the world. It is apt that a religion centered on the greatest law-breaker of all would
               struggle to
               lay our own laws in place.</p>
          <p>Here at the Circle, we make no attempt to impose a particular form of morality on anyone. We uphold a
               set of clearly defined rules in our Discord server, but these rules are in place to ensure our goals of
               community and mutual respect are achieved, not because we believe any of them are inherent to
               Satanism. In the end, the only one who can define a Satanist’s morality is that Satanist themself. That
               is
               the gift and the burden of Satanism – no one can tell you what to do, which means you must decide for
               yourself what is right and what is wrong. Your own moral compass is the highest authority on what
               Satanic values should look like. You do not have to agree with every Satanist's way of thinking, but it
               doesn't make them less of a Satanist for following their way. That is what our inherent right to lawless
               freedom upholds.</p>
          <h2>But wait, what about all the baby killing and goat sacrificing and stuff? Aren’t you guys evil?
               Doesn’t that mean you do all that horrible stuff?</h2>
          <p>Setting aside the question of what “evil” even means, the fact is that yes, there are some
               Satanists throughout history who have done some truly awful things. But that does not mean they had
               to, or that all (or even most) of us do those things.</p>
          <p>Pragmatically speaking, every religion has its extremists. It would be foolish to assume Satanism never
               gets used to justify abhorrent behavior. We at the Circle are not interested in playing a game of “no
               true Scotsman” and trying to argue that these people are not real Satanists – that’s between them and the
               big
               guy downstairs. What we are interested in is making it clear that regardless of what they are, we do not
               associate with them, and we do not encourage our members to break the law or partake in violence. In
               fact, we put a lot of effort into ensuring our community is a safe, supportive, and healing space for our
               members.</p>
          <h2>Does Satanism have a bible or other central holy text?</h2>
          <p>No. Individual Satanic groups may have their own scripture, and there are many independent Satanic
               authors out there, but no text unites all of Satanism.</p>
          <h2>Does Satanism have priests, monks, or other clergy?</h2>
          <p>Yes and no. Any given Satanic church or coven might create a spiritual hierarchy for their
               members, and any lone Satanist might self-initiate as one of these roles if they feel called to do so.
               However, as we have no dominant religious organization to verify such positions, those claiming these
               titles could be literally anyone, including conmen and scam artists. This is not to say everyone who
               calls themself a Satanic priest or something similar is a liar - far from it, some of them are completely
               serious and very devout. However, please don’t get the idea that someone can dictate your path to you
               just because they’re calling themself a priest.</p>
          <h2>Do Satanists believe in magic?</h2>
          <p>Some of us, yes, others no. Atheistic Satanists tend not to, though LaVeyans do have their own
               traditions of ritual magic, while theistic Satanists tend to be far more likely to at least dabble in it.
          </p>
          <h2>Can I sell my soul for riches, fame, love, etc?</h2>
          <p>Depends on who you ask and what you believe, but in general, we wouldn’t recommend it.
               You can get all of those things for a much lower price. No sense in undervaluing yourself!</p>
          <h2>I have a magical problem, can you help me?</h2>
          <p>We’re a religious community, not a consultation service, so we make no promises about being
               to assist anyone with a particular issue. However, if you want learned people to discuss your problem
               with, you could always join our community and see if you learn anything helpful.</p>
          <h2>Are the Illuminati Satanic? What about the Freemasons?</h2>
          <p>The actual historical Bavarian Illuminati has not existed for centuries, but when they did, they
               were actually pretty opposed to religion. The Freemasons have no religious requirements beyond
               believing in a “supreme being,” so hypothetically, a Satanist could also be a Freemason if his beliefs
               fit
               that definition, but the organization itself is not Satanic in any way.</p>
          <p>The facts about these so-called “secret societies” are now so accessible to the public that they both
               have
               detailed Wikipedia pages. Please read a history book and get off the social media conspiracy theory
               rabbit holes.</p>
          <h2>How do I become a Satanist?</h2>
          <p>Do you want to be a Satanist? Congrats, you're a Satanist.</p>
          <p>Satanism does not require initiation, baptism, or any other sort of entry process. We are a totally open
               religion and you don't need anyone's permission to join. Some folks may *want* to go through an
               initiation, in which case you are absolutely welcome to research your options and design a ritual for
               yourself, but it is not required. The gates of Hell are wide open, you can walk in at any time.</p>
          <p>And no, you don’t have to join the Circle of the Fallen (or any other group) to be a Satanist, either.
               While we would love to have you, we are not the gatekeepers of Satanism.</p>
          <h2> I heard I need to make a pact with Satan or another demon to become a Satanist, how do I
               do that?</h2>
          <p>Demonic pacts are a real practice which some Satanists choose to undergo, but they are by no
               means required or recommended for everyone. Here at the Circle we actually discourage beginners
               from pursuing a pact too quickly. Get your legs under you before you commit to something that
               powerful.</p>
          <h2>My family is religious, how do I tell them I’m a Satanist?</h2>
          <p>Many Satanists come from Christian or otherwise religious households, you aren’t alone.
               Before you tell anyone, we encourage you to think long and hard if it is wise or safe to do so. If it is
               at
               all possible that your family might abuse or endanger you if they find out about your interest in Satan,
               please do not tell them. Sometimes – oftentimes, even – we are required to keep our faith a secret in
               order to keep ourselves safe. In the Satanic community this is known as “tucking your horns,” and there
               is no shame in it. It might feel strange and stifling, especially if your life is filled with aspects of
               another religion you don’t follow, but your safety should come first.
               If you determine it is safe to tell your family, consider sending them this website, or using it to help
               you
               answer their questions.</p>
          <h2>Can I be a Satanist if I was baptized as a Christian or otherwise initiated into another
               religion?</h2>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. Anyone from any background can be a Satanist if they want to be. While it is
               not required, it is possible you may find some solace and closure in an unbaptizing ritual, which you
               can design yourself or pull from another source, several authors have published works that include such
               a ritual.</p>
