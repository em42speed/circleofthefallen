                <p>If you’re brand new to Satanism, or you’re needing a refresher, this is the place to be. Here you’ll find a selection of books and resources that we at the Circle of the Fallen consider to be very useful for any Satanist to be familiar with. Of course, they aren’t required reading – none of this library is. But word-for-word, these are some of the texts that have had the biggest impact on Satanism to date.</p>
              <h3>Websites</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href='https://www.angelfire.com/ny5/dvera/' target="_blank">Theistic Satanism by Diane Vera</a></li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Once called theisticsatanism.com, Diane Vera’s website and her now-defunct group the Church of Azazel is thought of fondly by nearly all Satanists who stumbled upon it early in their explorations. Though it is very much a relic of the past, it is a beloved relic, and still has much wisdom to share.</li></ul>
                <li><a href = "https://www.spiritualsatanist.com/" target = "_blank">Spiritual Satanism by Venus Satana </a>
                  <ul><li>Venus Satanas, author of Spiritual Satanist Prayer Book: Infernal Reflections has been a powerhouse in the online Satanic community for many years. On her website she shares her thoughts on philosophy, practice, and lifestyle for theistic Satanists. An excellent source of short, well-spoken blog posts about all aspects of theistic Satanism.</li>
                  <li>*Note: Some readers may be concerned by Venus Satanas’ use of the term Spiritual Satanism, as it is also used by the group known as Joy of Satan/Temple of Zeus. We at Circle of the Fallen have done our own background check and we have not seen any evidence that Venus Satanas was ever affiliated with JoS, despite starting to use the term at around the same time as them. This seems to be a coincidence.</li></ul>

              <h3>Books by Satanists</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href = "https://archive.org/details/the-satanic-bible_202310" target = "_blank">The Satanic Bible by Anton LaVey</a></li>
                    <ul><li>Culturally explosive, daringly phrased, and unquestionably plagerized, this book took the world by storm when it was first published, and it continues to be most people’s gateway into Satanism. Despite LaVey’s Church of Satan identifying themselves as an atheistic form of Satanism, LaVey’s work has been impactful on Satanists across the atheist-theist spectrum, especially in regards to philosophy and attitude. Whether you grow to love it or come to hate it, it’s worth reading.</li></ul>
                  <li><a href = "https://dn790008.ca.archive.org/0/items/andrew.chumbleyazoetia/Diabolicon.pdf" target = "_blank">Diabolicon by Michael Aquino</a> </li>
                    <ul><li>Former member of the Church of Satan and founder of the Church of Set, Michael Aquino provided some of the earliest known channeled Satanic scripture when he wrote and released The Diabolicon. It was far from the last piece of writing to come about in this way, and like all books, it should be read with a grain of salt, not unquestioning reverence. However, it has touched the hearts of many a Satanist, and especially at a time when the world was becoming convinced that theistic Satanism was impossible to pursue, this short little book raised many questions.</li></ul>
                  </ul>
                  <h3>Other Books</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href = "https://archive.org/details/the-new-oxford-annotated-bible-with-apocrypha-new-revised-standard-version-2018" target = "_blank">The New Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha, New Revised Standard Edition</a></li>
                        <ul>
                          <li>It may seem contraditionary to some, to ask Satanists to read the Bible. For some of you reading this, it may even be a very triggering ask. If that’s true for you, I advise you to take your time and feel no shame in putting this particular task off until you feel you are ready for it. But I do entreat all of you to eventually read the Bible. It is both the book that Satan is originally from, and the book that is most often weaponized against us. Learn it, and learn to see the glimses of Satan shining through. We recommend this particular edition, as it is meant for study rather than prayer, and is rich in scholarly footnotes to help add new meaning and context.</li></ul>
                        <li><a href = "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20" target = "_blank"> Lost by John Milton</a></li>
                          <ul><li>Despite being a Christian, Milton’s famous novel paints what is often considered to be the first sympathetic picture of Satan, as it depicts his fall from Heaven and subsequent tempting of Adam and Eve. While this book was never meant to be written for us, many Satanists take great enjoyment from this work, some of us even treat it as scripture.</li></ul>
                        <li><a href = "https://sacred-texts.com/bib/boe/index.htm" target = "_blank"> Book of Enoch</a></li>
                          <ul><li>This text is a piece of Jewish apocrypha, meaning it was at some point ment to be a holy book but was eventually rejected from the Hebrew Bible. It covers the story of the Watchers, a group of angels who came found from Heaven in order to procreate with human women, teaching humanity various skills and creating a race of giants in the process. While it is not favored by all Satanists, some of us find it a reach insight into the lives of fallen angels other that Satan himself.</li></ul>
                        <li><a href = "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/72679" target = "_blank">Lesser Key of Solomon</a> </li>
                          <ul><li>Perhaps the most impactful grimoire in history, The Lesser Key of Solomon claims to be a manual for the methods of sorcery used by King Solomon in the Bible when he made use of various demons to build the temple. While the magical methods described in the book are unsavory to many of us who respect demons, the list of 72 demonic spirits, along with their sigils, talents, and descriptions has been an invaluable inspiration to many Satanists, demonolators, and other practitioners of the Left Hand Path. If you’ve ever seen someone talk about “the Goetic demons,” this book is what they’re talking about!</li></ul>
