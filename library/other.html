                    <p>DISCLAIMER:</p>
                    <p>
                         Welcome, one and all, to the Library of the Fallen.
                         Here you will find a wealth of books and other
                         resources on Satanism, the occult, and other such
                         related subjects. This library is cultivated with the
                         intent of all sources being free and easily accessible
                         to the reader. All too often, knowledge of magic and
                         mysticism is locked behind paywalls, but here at the
                         Circle, we believe in sharing the fruit of knowledge as
                         widely as we possibly can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Please note that the books and sources shared here do
                         not necessarily reflect the beliefs, practices, or
                         politics of any individual member of the Circle of the
                         Fallen, including the founders and staff. Satanism is a
                         religion with no dogma, and this is a library, not a
                         required reading list. You do not have to read any
                         particular book to be a Satanist, nor will we ever
                         discourage anyone from reading any book. We are are
                         anti-censorship and pro-critical thinking.
                    </p>
