                         We cannot possibly host every book you may need to
                         complete your occult studies. With this in mind, we’ve
                         curated a list of other repositories of knowledge that
                         will enrich your studies. Most of these do not related
                         directly to Satanism, but they all contain invaluable
                         resources for anyone delving into the topic of
                         occultism.
