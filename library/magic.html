                    <p>
                         Magic (or “magick” if you’re feeling fancy) is the
                         fascination of many a Satanist. However, unlike some
                         religions, there is no set tradition of Satanic magic
                         one can trace back in time. Instead, we take a little
                         bit of everything, from whatever suits us, and twist it
                         to fit our morals and methods. While we cannot provide
                         a simple set of directions on how to become an adept
                         Satanic mage, we can offer a spread of different paths
                         for you to explore.
                    </p>
                    <p>Enjoy.</p>
                    <h2>Basics</h2>
                    <p>
                         We would advise the curious future magician to at least
                         look over these resources, even if you don’t commit to
                         studying them in depth. Not all of them are Satanic in
                         nature, but they all have their uses.

                                        While the Satanist is hardly bound to
                                        only dabble in Western magical methods,
                                        The Lesser Banishing Ritual of the
                                        Pentagram is a basic ritual that almost
                                        any practitioner can get use out of, but
                                        the original version’s requirements of
                                        calling on the names of God and various
                                        angels often makes the more demonically
                                        inclined practitioners of the world
                                        uncomfortable. To remedy this issue, Vox
                                        Serpentis, one of the three founders of
                                        the Circle of the Fallen, has designed a
                                        Satanic version of the banishing ritual.
                                        Use before any ritual, or on its own to
                                        clear your space and mind from unwanted
                                        energies, thoughts, and spirits.

                                        structure for our members to follow.
                                        However, we do encourage all community

                                        and we don’t expect most people to go
                                        through it all. But if you’re the type

                                        you’ll be well on your way.

                    <h3>Left Hand Path</h3>
                    <p>
                         Left Hand Path (LHP) is a rather squirrely term that is
                         defined differently by different people; for our
                         purposes, it means magical practices from the broad
                         Western tradition that dabble in demonic and culturally
                         tabboo practices. This, generally speaking, is the
                         broader catagory that Satanic magic tends to fall into.
                         However, as previously mentioned, this LHP catagory
                         pulls from many other traditions, and so we have
                         included several other catagories of magic that are
                         worth being passingly familiar with, so that the
                         well-round Satanic mage may recognize cross-tradition
                         references when they come up, and mix and match
                         different methods effectively.

                    <h3>Witchcraft</h3>
                    <p>
                         Originally thrown around as an insult and an accusation
                         towards practitioners of folk practices (or just about
                         anyone who stepped out of line, really) the word
                         “witchcraft” has been reclaimed in our modern day by
                         those who practice magick rooted in the world around
                         us. We could never provide an all-encompassing view of
                         witchcraft, but we believe these offerings will be
                         useful to any Satanist wishing to dip their toes into
                         the practice.

                    <h3>Chaos Magick</h3>
                    <p>
                         Perhaps the most exciting development of modern day
                         magick, the thesis of chaos magick is deceptively
                         simple – belief as a tool. This is an approach to
                         magick that has served many Satanists well, as it
                         encourages one to boldly experiment without the fear of
                         punishment by outside forces.

                    <p>
                         Who doesn’t crave to see the future, or learn knowledge
                         that is otherwise hidden to us? Divination is one of
                         the oldest forms of magick, with nearly every culture
                         in the world having some form of it. Here are a few you
                         can explore for yourself.
