                    <p>
                         There is no one way to practice Satanism, but that can
                         mean it can be quite difficult to know how to actually
                         start. This collection of resources is aimed at
                         answering some of the most basic questions you may have
                         about how to actually “do Satanism” in a religious way.

                                        It’s the sad truth that many Satanists
                                        must practice in secret, especially when
                                        young or dependent on family. This short
                                        book gives ideas and support to those
                                        who cannot display their faith loudly
                                        and proudly. While the author is a
                                        demonolator and thus speaks of
                                        demonolatry rather than Satanism, the
                                        lessons are still fully applicable to
                                        both faiths.

                                        The question of how much good magick can
                                        do in the realm of healing is always a
                                        hot one. Here at the Circle of the
                                        Fallen, we absolutely do not endorse
                                        using magick as a replacement for
                                        science-based medical intervention.
                                        However, if you’re still keen on knowing
                                        how healing and the Satanic faith can
                                        relate to one another, this book is a
                                        good place to start.
