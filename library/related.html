                    <h3>Atheistic Satanism</h3>
                    <p>
                         Atheistic Satanism may seem absurd to the unfamiliar,
                         but it is, in fact, the most well-known variety of the
                         religion. Characterized by having no literal belief in
                         Satan or any other gods, atheistic Satanists interpret
                         Satan as a symbol of rebellion and empowerment, chosing
                         to align themselves with him in spirit, even though
                         they do not believe he is literally real.

                    <h3>Theistic Satanism</h3>
                    <p>
                         Theistic Satanism simply means any form of Satanism
                         which involves belief in Satan as a literal existing
                         god or spirit in the world we live in. Almost
                         everything later on this list could technically be
                         considered a form of theistic Satanism. However, since
                         certain groups and authors claim more specific labels,
                         we’ve attempted to catagorize them as such. This
                         section is dedicated to texts and groups that, as far
                         as we know, can be considered theistically Satanic,
                         with no further specification needed.

                    <h3>Setianism</h3>
                    <p>
                         Setianism, or the Temple of Set, is often considered to
                         be the branch of theistic Satanism most associated with
                         LaVeyan Satanism. This is due to Setianism being
                         founded by Michael Aquino, a former friend of Anton
                         LaVey and member of the Church of Satan. Setians do not
                         always identify as Satanists, as they revere the
                         ancient Egyptian god, Set. However, they do syncretize
                         Set with Satan, and so they are included on this list.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Diabolism</h3>
                    <p>
                         Diabolism, literally meaning “devil worship,” was
                         coined to represent those who resent the assertion that
                         Satanists do not, in fact, worship the devil. This sets
                         the diabolist apart both from the atheistic Satanist
                         and the average theistic Satanist, as both of those
                         groups tend to strive for a form of self-deification.
                         Diabolists, on the other hand, tend to emphasize a more
                         typical deity/worshipper dynamic.

                    <h3>Demonolatry</h3>
                    <p>
                         Demonolatry is the worship of demons, though not
                         necessarily the worship of Satan himself. Originally
                         coined in the 1500s as an accusaion towards those being
                         framed for crimes of witchcraft, the word has been
                         reclaimed in the modern day by those who worship or
                         work with demons of all kinds.

                    <h3>Luciferianism</h3>
                    <p>
                         The question of Lucifer’s identity often arises in
                         discussions of Satan, and there are those who have
                         interpreted him as a seperate figure. Luciferians may
                         consider themselves to be part of the same Left Hand
                         Path family as Satanists, or they may take a more Pagan
                         approach, favoring Lucifer as the Roman deity of the
                         morning star.

                    <h3>Romantic Satanism</h3>
                    <p>
                         Romantic Satanism was not a religious movement, but
                         rather a literary one. Part of the broader Romantic
                         movement of 8th century Europe, Romantic Satanism is
                         often considered to be the first era of thought that
                         looked upon Satan with a sympathetic eye. Due to this,
                         the works that arose from the movement often inspire
                         modern religious Satanists, despite never being
                         intended to be read as religious works.
